👋 Hi, I'm Atijeh Kingston, 
    but you can just call me Teej/Tj

💫 I kind of just fell into coding and found a love for it.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Azure.

⚡🤓 I'm a huge fan of all things Harry Potter.

🗣️ I have been told I talk excessively.

FUN FACT: For those who are in the know....I used to be a metrognome. #ifyouknowyouknow
